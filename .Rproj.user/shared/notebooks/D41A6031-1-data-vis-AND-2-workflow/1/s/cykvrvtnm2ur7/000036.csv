"0","# 1. The mpg data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains 234 "
"0","# observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 car "
"0","# models. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are numerical? "
"0","# (Hint: Type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see "
"0","# this information when you run mpg?"
"0","# Answer: attempting to use the logic 'if bar plot makes sense' then maybe "
"0","# categorical + 'does it make sense to add, subtract, and/or average with this "
"0","# after reading ?mpg description' then maybe numerical, we have the following:"
"0","# numerical vars = {cty,hwy}, since makes sense to add/average/subtract these"
"0","# categorical vars = "
"0","# {manufacturer, model, displ, year, cyl, trans, drv, fl, class} since does not"
"0","# make sense to add/average/subtract these (except averaging for years, I guess)"
