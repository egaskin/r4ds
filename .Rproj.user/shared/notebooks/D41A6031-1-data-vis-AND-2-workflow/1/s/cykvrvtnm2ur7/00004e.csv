"0","# 2. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ using the mpg data frame. Next, map a "
"0","# third, numerical variable to color, then size, then both color and size, then "
"0","# shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical "
"0","# variables?"
"0","# Answer: color works well for both numerical and categorical - the colors can "
"0","# be assigned on a continuous gradient or discrete scale respectively. but, "
"0","# size doesn't seem to work very well for categorical or categorical-like vars"
"0","# such as cyl - in fact size throws a warning ""Using size for a discrete "
"0","# variable is not advised."" Being able to interpolate between sizes is intuitive"
"0","# which is lost for discrete vars."
