# 8 Workflow: getting help

## 8.1 Google is your friend
- google specific packages or error messages, adding "in R" as needed
- stack overflow is great, look for tags [R]

# 8.2 Make a reprex
reprex = reproducible example, two steps:
1. make code rpeproducible. capture all needed libraries and (subsetted) objects
2. make code minimal. strip away everything unrelated to problem. often, subset the object to a small example

R has a package `reprex` to help (which comes with tidyverse):

```{r}
y <- 1:4
mean(y)
```


```{r}
reprex::reprex() # AUTO copied to clipboard!
```
### output of reprex by pasting from clipboard
  
``` r
y <- 1:4
mean(y)
#> [1] 2.5
```

## 8.3 investing in yourself
learn a little bit of R daily. here's some good resources:
